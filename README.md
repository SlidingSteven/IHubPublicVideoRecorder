# IHub Video Recorder

Based off example from [this project](https://github.com/collab-project/videojs-record/).

## Thank you

A special thanks to Chris Tse for helping me navigate a lot of the things I was had no experience with.  It likely would not have made it this far without his help.

## How to Change HTML

IHubPublicVideoRecorder/templates
Here is a list of html files I used or considered using.
index.html is the home page
record.hmtl is the recording page
formpage.html is the page that will send the recording.

## Installing

First you will need to go to the [project](https://github.com/collab-project/videojs-record/) that built the code to do the recording.
After following the link, go to the installation section of their README and follow the steps to install their code.
Next  you should install Flask, which should also install pip and python. [Here] (http://timmyreilly.azurewebsites.net/python-flask-windows-development-environment-setup/) is a good set of instructions to do that.

## To Run

To run navigate to directory containing app.py and run the following in the terminal-
$ EMAIL_ADDRESS=ihubvids@gmail.com PASSWORD=ASK-ME python app.py

## How to Use

User will need to press the white circle to begin recording and then when they are finished they will need to press it again.
Next they will need to right click the recording and save it as a certain file.
To share it with us they will need to go to the share button, fill out the fields and attach their file. 

TODO: 
Pull to raspberrypi and test- I attempted this but ran out of time while doing updates
